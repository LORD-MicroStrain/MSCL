### What is MSCL?
MSCL is the MicroStrain Communication Library, developed by [LORD Sensing - Microstrain](http://microstrain.com) in Williston, VT. It was created to make it simple to interact with our [Wireless](http://www.microstrain.com/wireless) and [Inertial](http://www.microstrain.com/inertial) sensors.

### Programming Languages
MSCL is written in C++, but by using [SWIG](http://swig.org/) we are able to wrap it into a variety of languages.
The library is currently available in:
* C++
* Python (2.7 and 3.6)
* .NET (C#, VB, MATLAB, LabVIEW)
