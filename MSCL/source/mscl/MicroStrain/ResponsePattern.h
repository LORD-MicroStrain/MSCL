    //    A pattern matching the expected response from a device command (Base Class).
    //
    //Creating your own command/response:
    //    - Create a custom "Response" class that inherits from this class.
    //    - Create a custom version of one of the "match" functions that applies to your command.
    //    - In the match function, if the bytes match the expected response, return true.
    //    - Set m_success to whether the command succeeded (match a success response), or false (matched a fail response).
    //    - Set m_fullyMatched to true when all packets/bytes have been matched. Set it to false if the packet was matched
    //      but there are still more packets/bytes remaining (the case when 1 command has multiple responses before it is complete).
