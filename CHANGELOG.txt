MSCL Change Log - update with each release

The version number scheme in MSCL is as follows:
MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

The MAJOR version is incremented when changes are made (to the public interface) that are not backwards compatible.
The MINOR version is incremented when a new feature is added (to the public interface) or a current feature is improved upon.
The PATCH version is incremented when a bug is fixed.

Major revisions will specify what caused the non-backwards compatible change. These will be specified like so:
CHANGED - A non-backwards compatible change was made to an existing function/class.
RENAMED - A function/class has been renamed.
REMOVED - A function/class has been removed.

- Changed how SyncSamplingNetwork class works:
  - Creating a network now involves giving a BaseStation, not a frequency.
  - adding a node to the network changes its parent BaseStation to the network BaseStation and
    attempts to ping the node. If it fails, the node's parent BaseStation is set back to the original.

    with their old parent BaseStations while in the network and applying settings.

- Fix for crashing on destruction of connection when reading incoming data (threading/mutex issue).

0.11.0 - 2014-07-21
- InertialChannel object now has a SampleRate instead of a rate decimator, which would require the user
  to get the rate base and determine the decimator they wanted themselves. Now this is abstracted.
- Added supportedSampleRates function to get a list of all sample rates for a specific Inertial Channel Id.
- Changed WirelessNode's setBaseStation function to take a constant BaseStation ref.

  immediately set the Raw Byte Mode parsing function to that device's parsing function.

0.8.0 - 2014-07-02
- Added Raw Bytes Mode for the Connection object.

0.7.2 - 2014-06-29
- The BaseStation getData function now returns a shared_ptr to a vector of DataSweep objects.
- The InertialNode getDataPackets function now returns a shared_ptr to a vector of InertialDataPacket objects.
- The getData and getNextData functions on the BaseStation, and the getDataPackets and getNextDataPacket object are more efficient (less copying).
- When creating a BaseStation, the frequency is no longer immediately read.
  This means that there is no communication necessary at instantiation, however data that is collected.
  before the frequency is known on the base station will be stamped with an unknown frequency.

0.7.1 - 2014-06-26
- Support for 1 sample per 24 hours Wireless Sample Rate.
- To fix the Connection bug below, the Connection objects now listen for data as soon as they are created.
